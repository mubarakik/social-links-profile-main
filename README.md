## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to use arbitrary color values in Tailwind, when I couldn’t find an exact match in the default Tailwind color palette. Instead of settling for a close alternative, I learned to apply exact design values using HSL like this:

```html
<div class="bg-[hsl(0,_0%,_20%)] text-[hsl(75,_94%,_57%)]">content</div>
```

This showed me how highly customisable tailwind is.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Play CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) – This was my starting point for using Tailwind without setting up a full build process. It made it really easy to experiment and see results instantly, which was super helpful.

- [Tailwind Cheat Sheet – Nerdcave](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) - This cheat sheet was incredibly useful for quickly looking up class names and syntax while working on the project. It's a great reference to have open alongside your code.

- [Tailwind Color Reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors) – This helped me understand and apply Tailwind’s color system correctly. I referred to it often while matching the design specs and choosing semantic, accessible colors.

- [Tailwind Shadow Generator](https://folge.me/tools/tailwind-shadow-generator) – This helped me generate custom shadow values quickly and visually, making it easier to craft shadows that fit the exact offsets, blur, and colors I needed for this design.
